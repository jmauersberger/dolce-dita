# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

If you find an issue, please submit a pull request with a fix or improvement, if
you can, and include tests. If you don't know how to fix the issue but can write a test
that exposes the issue, we will accept that as well. In general, bug fixes that
include a regression test are merged quickly, while new features without proper
tests might be slower to receive feedback. The workflow to make a merge
request is as follows:

1. Fork the project into
   your personal namespace (or group) on GitLab.com.
1. Create a feature branch in your fork (don't work off `master`).
1. Write tests and code.
1. Follow the general Github commit messages guidelines
1. If you have multiple commits, combine them into a few logically organized
   commits by squashing them but do not change the commit history if you're working on shared branches though.
1. Push the commit(s) to your working branch in your fork.
1. Submit a merge request (MR) to the `master` branch in the main GitLab project.
   1. Your merge request needs at least 1 approval, but depending on your changes
      you might need additional approvals.
   1. You don't have to select any specific approvers, but you can if you really want
      specific people to approve your merge request.
1. The MR title should describe the change you want to make.
1. The MR description should give a reason for your change.
   1. If you are contributing code, fill in the description according to the default
      template already provided in the "Description" field.
   1. If you are contributing documentation, choose `Documentation` from the
      "Choose a template" menu and fill in the description according to the template.
   1. Mention the issue(s) your merge request solves, using the `Solves #XXX` or
      `Closes #XXX` syntax to auto-close
      the issue(s) once the merge request is merged.
1. If you're allowed to, set a relevant milestone and labels
